1. In a small bowl or mason jar, whisk together the Tahini, lemon juice, garlic, olive oil, and sweetener until a thick paste forms.
2. Add the cumin, salt, and pepper.
3. Slowly drizzle in the ice-cold water 1 tablespoon at a time, whisking vigorously after each addition. 
   *Note: The sauce will "seize" and look broken at first, but keep whisking; it will eventually turn smooth, pale, and creamy.*
4. Continue adding water until it reaches your desired consistency (thicker for a dip, thinner for a salad dressing).
5. Taste and adjust lemon or salt as needed. Store in the fridge for up to 1 week.
