1. In a large pot, fry the Smoked Bacon until crisp. Remove the bacon, crumble it, and set it aside.
2. Add a couple of tablespoons of butter to the bacon fat. Sauté the Walla Walla Sweet Onion, Chanterelle Mushrooms, and Garlic until they are soft and translucent.
3. Add the chopped Celery, Carrots, and Potato. Cook for about five minutes, stirring occasionally.
4. Sprinkle in the Flour and add more Butter if needed. Stir well for a minute or two to cook the raw flour taste out (doing this now prevents clumping later).
5. Gradually pour in the Chicken Stock while stirring. Add the Bay Leaves, Fresh Thyme, and the crumbled Bacon back into the pot.
6. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer until the potatoes and carrots are fork-tender.
7. Add the chopped Razor Clams along with all their juices. Bring the pot back to a very light boil for just a minute (don't overcook the clams or they will get tough).
8. Pour in the Half & Half, turn the heat to low, and let the chowder simmer for at least ten minutes to allow flavors to meld.
9. Taste and adjust Salt and Pepper before serving.
