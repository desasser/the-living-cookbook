# Instructions
1. Remove stems, veins, and seeds from the dried chiles
2. Heat a nonstick frying pan over medium heat. When hot, add the chilies and cook just unitl they start to change color, pressing down occasionally. Flip chilies and repeat on the second side.
3. Put the toasted chilies into a pie plate, fill part-way full with water and make sure they remain submerged. Soak for 30-45 minutes.
4. Once done soaking, put them into a food blender alongwith onion, garlic, oregano, cilantro, and cumin. Add around a cup of soaking liquid and puree. Strain through a wire mesh.
