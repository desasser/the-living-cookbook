# Instructions
1. Soak corn husks in bowling water for about an hour until soft.
2. Combine masa, salt, and baking powder in a medium bowl
3. Add warm broth or water and stir until a soft dough begins to form
4. Beat lard in a bowl of a stand mizer fitted with a paddle on medium speed until fluffy, about 1 minute.
5. Add dry ingredients and beat on medium speed until masa is smooth, 2-3 minutes. Should sound slappy like creamed butter
6. The dough should be soft and fluffy like cake batter
7. Drain husks and set aside 20 largest leaves.  Place husks, concabe side up on a clean surface, wide end nearest you.
8. Spread 1/4 cup masa across bottom third husk , leaving 1/2" border at wide end.  Spread a scant tablespoon of chili sauce over masa, and spread 1 1/2 tablespoon meat on top.
9. Gather long sides of husk together and pinch along seam to ensure that masa encases filling.  Fold husk in half crosswise.
10. Repeat process to make 20 tamales in all.  Place tamales upright, leaning them against one another in top of a steamer.
11. Place steamer over a pot of simmering water over medium heat, cover with a clean dish towel, and cover with a lid.
12. Steam until masa comes away from husk easily, about 1-2 hours. Allow to rest for 10 minutes, then unwrap and serve in husks, moistened with remaining sauce
